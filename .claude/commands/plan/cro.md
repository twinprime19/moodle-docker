## Conversion Optimization Framework

1. Headline 4-U Formula: Useful, Unique, Urgent, Ultra-specific (80% won't read past this)
2. Above-Fold Value Proposition: Customer problem focus, no company story, zero scroll required
3. CTA First-Person Psychology: "Get MY Guide" vs "Get YOUR Guide" (90% more clicks)
4. 5-Field Form Maximum: Every field kills conversions, progressive profiling for the rest
5. Message Match Precision: Ad copy, landing page headline, broken promises = bounce
6. Social Proof Near CTAs: Testimonials with faces/names, results, placed at decision points
7. Cognitive Bias Stack: Loss aversion (fear), social proof (FOMO), anchoring (pricing)
8. PAS Copy Framework: Problem > Agitate > Solve, emotion before logic
9. Genuine Urgency Only: Real deadlines, actual limits, fake timers destroy trust forever
10. Price Anchoring Display: Show expensive option first, make real price feel like relief
11. Trust Signal Clustering: Security badges, guarantees, policies all visible together
12. Visual Hierarchy F-Pattern: Eyes scan F-shape, put conversions in the path
13. Lead Magnet Hierarchy: Templates > Checklists > Guides (instant > delayed gratification)
14. Objection Preemption: Address top 3 concerns before they think them, FAQ near CTA
15. Mobile Thumb Zone: CTAs where thumbs naturally rest, not stretching required
16. One-Variable Testing: Change one thing, measure impact, compound wins over time
17. Post-Conversion Momentum: Thank you page sells next step while excitement peaks
18. Cart Recovery Sequence: Email in 1 hour, retarget in 4 hours, incentive at 24 hours
19. Reading Level Grade 6: Smart people prefer simple, 11-word sentences, short paragraphs
20. TOFU/MOFU/BOFU Logic: Awareness content â‰  decision content, match intent precisely
21. White Space = Focus: Empty space makes CTAs impossible to miss, crowded = confused
22. Benefit-First Language: Features tell, benefits sell, transformations compel
23. Micro-Commitment Ladder: Small yes leads to big yes, start with email only
24. Performance Tracking Stack: Heatmaps show problems, recordings show why, events show what
25. Weekly Optimization Ritual: Review metrics Monday, test Tuesday, iterate or scale

## Workflow

- If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `eyes_analyze` tool from Human MCP to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure copywriter can fully understand the issue easily based on the description.
- If the user provides a URL, use `web_fetch` tool to fetch the content of the URL and analyze the current issues.
- You can use `screenshot` tools from "human" mcp server to capture screenshots of the exact parent container and analyze the current issues with `eyes_analyze` tool.
- Use multiple `scouter` agents to scout the current codebase or given codebase (if any) to understand the context, then report back to `copywriter` agent.
- Use `planner` agent to create a comprehensive CRO plan, then report back to main agent.
- Do not start implementing the CRO plan yet, wait for the user to approve the plan first.

**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
