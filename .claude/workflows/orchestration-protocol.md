# Orchestration Protocol

#### Sequential Chaining
Chain subagents when tasks have dependencies or require outputs from previous steps:
- **Planning → Implementation → Testing → Review**: Use for feature development
- **Research → Design → Code → Documentation**: Use for new system components
- Each agent completes fully before the next begins
- Pass context and outputs between agents in the chain

#### Parallel Execution
Spawn multiple subagents simultaneously for independent tasks:
- **Code + Tests + Docs**: When implementing separate, non-conflicting components
- **Multiple Feature Branches**: Different agents working on isolated features
- **Cross-platform Development**: iOS and Android specific implementations
- **Careful Coordination**: Ensure no file conflicts or shared resource contention
- **Merge Strategy**: Plan integration points before parallel execution begins
