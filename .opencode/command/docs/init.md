description: Analyze the codebase and create initial documentation
---

Use `docs/` directory as the source of truth for documentation.
Use `docs-manager` agent to analyze the codebase and create initial documentation:
- `docs/project-overview-pdr.md`: Project overview and PDR (Product Development Requirements)
- `docs/codebase-summary.md`: Codebase summary
- `docs/codebase-structure-architecture-code-standards.md`: Codebase structure, architecture, and code standards

**IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.
